# Medical Health Assistant Bot (PDF-Based QA System)

This project is a lightweight, offline **Medical Health Assistant** that helps users get simple, actionable medical advice from a medical handbook PDF.  
It uses **Semantic Search + Chunked Retrieval** to answer health-related queries like "What should I do for a fever?" without requiring internet APIs.

## üöÄ Features

- **PDF-Based Knowledge:** Load any medical handbook (Merck Manual, Red Cross Manual, etc.) and build a local intelligent assistant.
- **Semantic Understanding:** Uses `SentenceTransformer` models to understand user questions meaningfully.
- **Fast Search Engine:** Powered by `FAISS` for real-time answer retrieval.
- **Action-Focused Responses:** Filters and extracts practical "what to do" sentences.
- **Optimized for Normal Users:** Removes unnecessary medical jargon, technical terms, and complicated descriptions.
- **Lightweight Deployment:** No heavy language models (like GPT) needed ‚Äî works even on laptops.
- **Customizable Dataset:** Easily switch PDFs to target different health domains (home care, emergencies, travel medicine, etc.)
